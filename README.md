Powershell scripts 

In this repository you can find three ps1 files:

Test.ps1 - Powershell a script that uses the library to create a graphical window with information about the PC.

InsstallConvertModule.ps1 - Powershell script for installing and checking the installation of the ps2exe module

ConvertScript - Powershell script with a command to convert this or your script. In it you need to make changes to where to save and where to take the file from.

The big advantage of this solution is that there is no need to use third-party software or change the script execution policy.
